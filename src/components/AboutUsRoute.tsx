          During the last 10 years in the fitness industry, I have worked on a
          small core team, led multiple high-volume projects and events with
          attendances over two hundred people and managed and mentored hundreds
          of individuals. Throughout my project management experience, I have
          always been drawn to the tech aspects of my career, including building
          our company website and app. Therefore, I cannot wait to switch gears
          into the tech industry and become a front-end developer. I am
          passionate about designing digital user experiences and excited to
          apply my creative and technical skills. My goal is not only to become
          a web developer, but also to find a team that allows me to continue to
          grow and learn while inspiring others along the way.

            Highly efficient and creative teamplayer, with 5 years of previous
            experience in educational services and customer service. Currently
            completing the JavaScript coding bootcamp with Grand Circus in order
            to transition to the tech industry. When I studied fashion at the
            university, I had a chance to learn photoshop and was also
            interested in web design so I studied html and css which I really
            enjoyed. While changing careers is scary, I am embracing the unknown
            and turning that fear into excitement for what's next in my goals to
            become a full stack developer. I am particularly excited to leverage
            strengths in Javascript, Typescript, and React in order to create
            clean, user friendly, and accessible websites.
